# Enjoy Coding

## Introduction

I studied computer science major but for a long time, I am always afraid of algorithms. It's funny, isn't it? :)

Firstly, I felt bad when I could not solve code challenges well although they weren't actually too difficult. One more thing is lots of great companies in which the interview process starts with code challenge. If I am not good enough at algorithms and coding, I will have no chances to apply their great jobs.

Finally, I decide to do something really seriously. I started studying again about algorithms by reading books and solving code challenges. Many people recommend LeetCode, so I just started with LeetCode. This repository contains problems and test cases, then I will code and test them in any languages I know.

If you find any interesting problems or figure out something is missing in my test cases, plese let me know!
